# onlineClassroomSystem 🌟

The Online Classroom Allocation System represents an advanced initiative intended to optimize and modernize the procedural aspects associated with classroom allocation in
educational institutions. This sophisticated system is designed to deliver an effective and user-friendly web-based application, streamlining the process of verifying
classroom availability and status. The principal objective of this project is to elevate the user experience for class representatives, lecturers, and other authorized
individuals engaged in classroom allocation tasks. Each classroom will be designated a distinctive digital tag, facilitating straightforward identification. Users
accessing the web-based application will seamlessly navigate the system to ascertain classroom availability by referencing these assigned digital tags.
